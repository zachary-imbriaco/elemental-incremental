# Elemental Incremental
A react-based incremental game by Zachary Imbriaco.

## Why EleInc Exists
I have always been a huge fan of various incremental games, and wanted to go about building one of my own.

## Build Status
EleInc is not at this time built.

## Tech/Framework used
**Built with:**
- React
- Redux

## Features
TBD

## Tests
At this time, EleInc does not have working tests, as it has yet to be properly built and deployed.

## Contributing
As long as you can explain clearly what you've added and show that it will positively contribute to the development of the project, it'll probably get merged in.

## License
EleInc uses an MIT license.
